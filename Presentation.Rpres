Presentation
========================================================

The final project's requirements are to create a Shiny application and to use RStudio Presenter (or Slidify) to build a presentation. This application ask the user to select one of two possible theoretical distributions (Normal or Exponential), then choose a sample size and finally choose appropiate parameters
for plot a histogram of the desired distribution by generating random distributions. The links to the GitHub repo, RStudio Presentation, and a Shiny Application are located at the last slide of this presentation.




Generating Random Normal 
========================================================

```{r}
size = 100000

mean = 0

sd = 1

randomVec = rnorm(size,mean,sd)
```

Generating Histogram
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(randomVec, col = "blue")
```
